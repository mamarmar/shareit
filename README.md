# ShareIt

ShareIt web app allows you to borrow and lend items within your community. Do you need something for a day? Just ask for it. Do you have something that someone else needs? Just offer it to them.

By buying less you do your part in reducing your ecological foorprint, in line with the first 'R' of [the '3 Rs' of waste management (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_management#Principles_of_waste_management).
